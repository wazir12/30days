# Day 25: Running Time and Complexity

Task 

A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than  and itself. Given a number, n, determine and print whether it's prime or not prime.

Note: If possible, try to come up with a O(root(n)) primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an O(n) algorithm. Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code!

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases. 
Each of the T subsequent lines contains an integer, n, to be tested for primality.

Constraints

Output Format

For each test case, print whether n is Prime or Not prime  on a new line.
