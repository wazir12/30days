**Task**   
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables iii, ddd, and sss are already declared and initialized for you. You must declare 333 variables: one of type _int_, one of type _double_, and one of type _String_. Then you must read 333 lines of input from stdin and initialize your 333 variables. Finally, you must use the +++ operator to perform the following operations:
 
- Print the sum of iii plus your int variable on a new line. 
- Print the sum of ddd plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line. 
- Concatenate sss with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line. 

**Note:** If you are using a language that doesn't support using +++ for string concatenation (e.g.: CC\text{C}), you can just print one variable immediately following the other on the same line. The string provided in your editor _must_ be printed first, immediately followed by the string you read as input.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, iii.   
The second line contains a double, ddd.   
The third line contains a string, sss.

**Output Format**

Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles on the second line, and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.
